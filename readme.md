# netcore-postgres-oauth-boiler

[![Status](https://travis-ci.org/scharkee/netcore-postgres-oauth-boiler.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/scharkee/netcore-postgres-oauth-boiler)

A basic .NET Core website boilerplate using PostgreSQL for storage, Adminer for db management, Let's Encrypt for SSL certificates and Nginx for routing.

[Demo website.](https://netcore.demos.matasr.com)

## Features

-   Vanilla .NET Core Server Setup:
    -   Razor pages, upholstered with the Materialize css toolkit
    -   Server -> client data rendering demo
    -   Native Entity Framework database interface, with PostgreSQL
    -   Asynchronous design
    -   Auth gated route examples
-   User authentication via:
    -   Regular email/password
    -   Google
    -   Github
    -   Reddit
-   Auth method merging, linking and unlinking of social auth accounts
-   TLS/HTTPS:
    -   Automatic certificate generation powered by Let's Encrypt
    -   Hosting modes:
        -   Self hosted mode (443/80 port access required)
        -   Simple mode (just the Dockerfile, http only), for use with reverse proxy configurations
-   A lightweight PostgreSQL management tool included - Adminer

## Configuration

1.  Open the docker-compose file you're going to use (depends on your platform) and set `CERTBOT_EMAIL` to your email for Let's Encrypt certificate generation. Moreover, set `DOMAIN` to your domain name. The domain should point to the IP of the machine you're running this project on.
2.  The file `appsettingsExample.json` needs to be renamed to `appsettings.json` with your own OAuth keys:

-   The process for obtaining a Google key is described [here](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2).
-   The method to create a Github app in order to get an API key is described [here](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app/).
-   The process for creating a Reddit app in order to get an API key is described [here](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/OAuth2#getting-started).

## Running the boilerplate

-   Standalone:

```bash
# clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/Scharkee/netcore-postgres-oauth-boiler.git
$ cd netcore-postgres-oauth-boiler
# perform configuration...

# generate TLS certificates and run on ports 80/443
# choose between docker-compose-linux.yml and docker-compose-windows.yml
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-linux.yml up
```

For an explanation of the docker-compose file separation, take a look at [Running on Windows](#running-on-windows).

-   Through Visual Studio:

1. Launch Visual Studio
2. Right-click on the `docker-compose` section in the Solution Explorer, and click `Set as Startup Project`
3. Select either Debug or Release at the top and click the `Docker Compose` button to run.

### Overview of services

1. Boilerplate runs on port 3000, and is accessible through the configured domain with managed TLS
2. PostgreSQL runs on 5432
3. Adminer (for managing PostgreSQL) runs and can be accessed on port 8080 (localhost:8080 in a browser).
4. Nginx runs on ports 80 and 443. Make sure no servers/web hosts/etc. are using those ports.

### Running the boilerplate independently

If you're behind Nginx or a similar reverse proxy setup, you can either:

1. Adjust the compose file so it no longer contains the Nginx container
2. Run only the boilerplate (you will have to run PostgreSQL separately):
    - Adjust the `DefaultConnection` in appsettings.json in accordance with your database
    - run `docker build . --tag boiler`
    - run `docker run boiler -p 3000:80 --name boiler`

### Running on Windows

Docker on Windows has an open issue with local volume mapping permissions, which results in PostgreSQL not being able to write to a (relative) local directory. Thus, when running on Windows (via run.sh), an external volume is created, which is managed by Docker.

Moreover, if you encounter a PR_END_OF_FILE_ERROR when trying to load the website, try executing:

```
$ docker exec nginx bash -c "mv /etc/nginx/conf.d/boiler.conf{.nokey,} ; nginx -s reload"
```

This seems to be a symlink issue with Windows Docker containers as well. After renaming the file once, it does not need to be touched anymore (unless you purge the nginx container).
